# Serverless Event-Driven Application with AWS SQS, SNS, and Lambda

This repository contains a **serverless, event-driven application** built using **AWS SNS, SQS, Lambda, and CloudWatch**. The system processes messages asynchronously, ensuring **scalability, reliability, and automation**.

## Project Overview

Modern applications often use **microservices architecture**, where components are **decoupled**. AWS **Simple Queue Service (SQS)** provides a robust mechanism for these services to communicate asynchronously.

This project enables:
- Users to submit notifications to an SNS topic.
- SQS queues to act as a buffer, ensuring reliable message processing.
- Lambda functions to be triggered by SQS, processing messages and logging outputs to CloudWatch. Check out the steps and implementation in the documentation [here](Event-driven%20Application%20with%20Amazon%20SQS.pdf).
